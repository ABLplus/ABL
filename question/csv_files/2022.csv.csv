1," <p>""Rapid Financing Instrument"" and ""Rapid Credit Facility"" are related to the provisions of lending by which one of the following?</p>",(a) Asian Development Bank,(b) International Monetary Fund,(c) United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative,(d) World Bank,Current Affairs,b,Easy,,"<ul><li>Recent context: The Finance minister of Sri Lanka has started bailout talks with the lender of last resort (IMF) and seeking IMF’s rapid financial assistance to tackle growing shortages of food, fuel and medicines.</li><li>The Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) provides rapid financial assistance, which is available to all member countries facing an urgent balance of payments need. The RFI was created as part of a broader reform to make the IMF’s financial support more flexible to address the diverse needs of member countries. The RFI replaced the IMF’s previous emergency assistance policy and can be used in a wide range of circumstances.</li><li>Financial assistance under the RFI is provided in the form of outright purchases without the need for a full-fledged program or reviews. A member country requesting RFI assistance is required to cooperate with the IMF to make efforts to solve its balance of payments difficulties and to describe the general economic policies that it proposes to follow. Prior actions may be required where warranted.</li><li>The Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) of IMF provides rapid concessional financial assistance to low-income countries (LICs) facing an urgent balance of payments (BoP) need with no ex post conditionality where a full-fledged economic program is neither necessary nor feasible. The RCF was created under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) as part of a broader reform to make the Fund’s financial support more flexible and better tailored to the diverse needs of LICs, including in times of crisis.</li><li>Hence option (b) is the current answer.</li></ul>"
2," <p>With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements :</p><p>1. An increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates the appreciation of rupee.</p><p>2. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates an improvement in trade competitiveness.</p><p>3. An increasing trend in domestic inflation relative to inflation in other countries is likely to cause an increasing divergence between NEER and REER.</p><p>Which of the above statements are correct?</p>",(a) 1 and 2 only,(b) 2 and 3 only,(c) 1 and 3 only,"(d) 1, 2 and 3",Economics (Macroeconomics),c,Medium,,"<ul><li>Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) is a measure of the value of a currency against a weighted average of several foreign currencies. The nominal exchange rate is the amount of domestic currency needed to purchase foreign currency. If a domestic currency increases against a basket of other currencies inside a floating exchange rate regime, NEER is said to appreciate. If the domestic currency falls against the basket, the NEER depreciates. An increase in NEER indicates an appreciation of the local currency against the weighted basket of currencies of its trading partners. Hence statement 1 is correct.</li><li>Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is the real effective exchange rate (a measure of the value of a currency against a weighted average of several foreign currencies) divided by a price deflator or index of costs. In simple words, a nation's nominal effective exchange rate (NEER), adjusted for inflation in the home country, equals its real effective exchange rate (REER). An increase in REER implies that exports become more expensive and imports become cheaper; therefore, an increase indicates a loss in trade competitiveness. Hence statement 2 is not correct.</li><li>REER is the NEER after factoring in relative inflation (consumer price-based index) using some measure of relative prices or costs; changes in the REER thus take into account both nominal exchange rate changes and the inflation differential vis-à-vis trading partners. Soaring inflation will impact REER, which, in turn, would inevitably push up the cost of merchandise and affect competitiveness of Indian exports. Thus, if inflation is in an increasing trend in domestic nation relative to inflation in other countries, there is likely to cause an increasing divergence between NEER and REER. For instance, considering NEER and REER values between April 2019 and May 2021 in India, the NEER has been mostly declining, whereas, REER remains in sync with the inflationary trends—the upward biases in REER due to inflation was already being felt in May 2021. The increasing difference between trends of NEER and REER in the last 26 months was due to India’s domestic inflation being higher relative to the six major currencies considered. Hence statement 3 is correct.</li></ul>"
3," <p>With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:</p><p>1. If the inflation is too high, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to buy government securities.</p><p>2. If the rupee is rapidly depreciating, RBI is likely to sell dollars in the market.</p><p>3. If interest rates in the USA or European Union were to fall, that is likely to induce RBI to buy dollars.</p><p>Which of the statements given above are correct ?</p>",(a) 1 and 2 only,(b) 2 and 3 only,(c) 1 and 3 only,"(d) 1, 2 and 3",Economics (Macroeconomics),b,Medium,,"<ul><li>A central bank such as Reserve Bank of India (RBI), periodically intervenes in the debt market to influence the interest rates and rate of inflation in the economy. If RBI feels inflation is too high, it will sell government securities, and suck money out of the system. This act will push up interest rates in the economy, and business will cut back on capital expenditure financed by loans, reducing the demand for money. Hence statement 1 is not correct.</li><li>Central banks also intervene periodically in foreign exchange markets. If the rupee is rapidly depreciating, RBI will sell dollars in the market. This will increase the supply of dollars and the demand for rupees, causing the rupee price of the dollar to come down. On the contrary, if the rupee is rapidly appreciating, RBI will buy dollars and inject rupees into the economy. This will increase the demand for dollars and the supply of rupees, thereby leading to an increase in the rupee price of the dollar. Hence statement 2 is correct.</li><li>Interest rate movements in a foreign economy can stimulate action on the part of RBI. If interest rates in the US or the EU were to fall, FIIs (Foreign Institutional investors) will ramp up investments in India. The resultant demand for rupees will cause the rupee to appreciate. In response, RBI will buy dollars and inject rupees in to the system. Hence statement 3 is correct. </li></ul>"
4," <p>With reference to the ""G20 Common Framework"", consider the following statements:</p><p>1. It is an initiative endorsed by the G20 together with the Paris Club.</p><p>2. It is an initiative to support Low Income Countries with unsustainable debt.</p><p>Which of the statements given above is/are correct?</p>",(a) 1 only,(b) 2 only,(c) Both 1 and 2,(d) Neither 1 nor 2,Current Affairs,c,Medium,,"<ul><li>The Common Framework for debt treatment beyond the DSSI (Common Framework) is an initiative endorsed by the G20, together with the Paris Club, to support, in a structural manner, low income countries with unsustainable debt. It is a way to temporarily ease the financing constraints for these countries and free up scarce money that they can instead use to mitigate the human and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Hence both statements 1 and 2 are correct.</li></ul>"
5," <p>With reference to the Indian economy, what are the advantages of ""Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs)"" ?</p><p>1. Government can reduce the coupon rates on its borrowing by way of IIBs.</p><p>2. IIBs provide protection to the investors from uncertainty regarding inflation.</p><p>3. The interest received as well as capital gains on IIBs are not taxable.</p><p>Which of the statements given above are correct?</p>",(a) 1 and 2 only,(b) 2 and 3 only,(c) 1 and 3 only,"(d) 1, 2 and 3",Economics (Macroeconomics),a,Medium,,"<ul><li>Inflation-indexed bonds in India were issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2013 and were benchmarked to Wholesale Price Index (WPI).</li><li>Inflation-indexed bonds are financial instruments that attempt to protect the bonds' purchasing power by tying interest and principal payments to an index of price changes. Indexed bonds include two types of compensation, a real rate of return plus a compensation for the erosion of purchasing power. Inflation component on principal will not be paid with interest but the same would be adjusted in the principal by multiplying principal with index ratio (IR). At the time of redemption, adjusted principal or the face, whichever is higher, would be paid. Interest rate will be provided protection against inflation by paying fixed coupon rate on the principal adjusted against inflation. Hence statement 2 is correct.</li><li>Economists have argued that inflation indexed bonds could reduce government borrowing costs. If the market overestimates future inflation, government will reduce borrowing costs by issuing inflation indexed bonds rather than nominal bonds. This may occur because, for example, investors• expectations are not completely forward-looking or rational. Alternatively, the government, because it is able to influence inflation through its policies, may have better information about the future course of inflation, or perhaps has more faith in its commitment to contain it than the public does. In these cases a treasury can lower its costs by issuing indexed bonds. For example, if coupon rate of IIBs is fixed 1.5 % above WPI (Whole sale price index) and current WPI is 4%, so effective rate will be 5.5% (4+1.5). In future, when WPI falls from 4% to 2%, then effective coupon rate will become 3.5% (i.e. 2+1.5) and thus government can reduce the coupon rates on its borrowing by way of IIBs through reducing inflationary trends. Hence statement 1 is correct.</li><li>Extant tax provisions will be applicable on interest payment and capital gains on IIBs. There will be no special tax treatment for these bonds. Hence statement 3 is not correct.</li></ul>"
6," <p>With reference to foreign-owned e-commerce firms, operating in India, which of the following statements is/are correct?</p><p>1. They can sell their own goods in addition to offering their platforms as market-places.</p><p>2. The degree to which they can own big sellers on their platforms is limited.</p><p>Select the correct answer using the code given below:</p>",(a) 1 only,(b) 2 only,(c) Both 1 and 2,(d) Neither 1 nor 2,Economics (Macroeconomics),b,Difficult,t,"<ul><li>Consumer Protection (E-Commerce)</li><li>Rules, 2020 define e-commerce entity (also foreign owned) as any person who owns, operates or manages digital or electronic facility or platform for electronic commerce, but does not include a seller offering his goods or services for sale on a marketplace e-commerce entity. Hence statement 1 is not correct. </li><li>Marketplace based model of e-commerce means providing an IT platform by an e-commerce entity on a digital &amp; electronic network to act as a facilitator between buyer and seller. On other hand, Inventory based model of e-commerce means an e-commerce activity where inventory of goods and services is owned by e-commerce entity and is sold to the consumers directly. However, FDI is not permitted in inventory based model of e-commerce.</li><li>According to guidelines for FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) on E-Commerce, E-commerce entity providing a marketplace will not exercise ownership or control over the inventory i.e. goods purported to be sold. Such an ownership or control over the inventory will render the business into inventory based model. Inventory of a vendor will be deemed to be controlled by e-commerce marketplace entity if more than 25% of purchases of such vendor are from the marketplace entity or its group companies. Hence statement 2 is correct.</li></ul>"
7, <p>Which of the following activities constitute real sector in the economy?</p><p>1. Farmers harvesting their crops</p><p>2. Textile mills converting raw cotton into fabrics</p><p>3. A commercial bank lending money to a trading company</p><p>4. A corporate body issuing Rupee Denominated Bonds overseas</p><p>Select the correct answer using the code given below:</p>,(a) 1 and 2 only,"(b) 2, 3 and 4 only","(c) 1, 3 and 4 only","(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4",Economics (Macroeconomics),a,Easy,,"<ul><li>The real sector of an economy is the key section as activities of this sector persuade economic output and is</li><li>represented by those economic segments that are essential for the progress of GDP of the economy. For instance, farmers harvesting their crops or textile mills converting raw cotton into fabrics ensure increase of economic output and in turn progress of GDP. The sector is crucial for the sustainability of the economy because of its productive capability to meet nations’ aggregate demand. Hence statements 1 and 2 are correct.</li><li>On other hand, the financial sector is a section of the economy made up of firms and institutions that provide financial services to commercial and retail customers. The financial sector generates a good portion of its revenue from loans and mortgages. This sector comprises a broad range of industries including banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and real estate firms. Thus, a commercial bank lending money to a trading company or a corporate body issuing rupee denominated bonds overseas constitute financial sector activities and not real sector activities. Hence statements 3 and 4 are not correct.</li></ul>"
8," <p>Which one of the following situations best reflects ""Indirect Transfers"" often talked about in media recently with reference to India?</p>",(a) An Indian company investing in a foreign enterprise and paying taxes to the foreign country on the profits arising out of its investment,(b) A foreign company investing in India and paying taxes to the country of its base on the profits arising out of its investment,(c) An Indian company purchases tangible assets in a foreign country and sells such assets after their value increases and transfers the proceeds to India,(d) A foreign company transfers shares and such shares derive their substantial value from assets located in India,Economics (Macroeconomics),d,Medium,,"<ul><li>Indirect transfers refer to situations where when foreign entities own shares or assets in India, the shares of such foreign entities are transferred instead of a direct transfer of the underlying assets in India. Hence option (d) is the correct answer.</li><li>The origin of retrospective taxation can be traced backed to 2012, When Vodafone Ltd. was retrospectively taxed by the Indian tax authorities for a 2007 deal. The 2012 act had amended the IT act to impose tax liability on the income earned from the sale of shares of a foreign company on a retrospective basis (i.e., also applicable to the transactions done before May 28, 2012). The amendments made by the 2012 Act clarified that if a company is registered or incorporated outside India, its shares will be deemed to be or have always been situated in India if they derive their value substantially from the assets located in India. As a result, the persons who sold such shares of foreign companies before the enactment of the Act (i.e., May 28, 2012) also became liable to pay tax on the income earned from such sale. </li><li>The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2021 nullifies the ‘retrospective taxation’ that was introduced with the Finance Act of 2012. It nullifies this tax liability imposed on such persons provided they fulfil certain conditions. These conditions are:</li><li>(i) if the person has filed an appeal or petition in this regard, it must be withdrawn or the person must submit an undertaking to withdraw it,</li><li>(ii) if the person has initiated or given notice for any arbitration, conciliation, or mediation proceedings in this regard, the notices or claims under such proceedings must be withdrawn or the person must submit an undertaking to withdraw them,</li><li>(iii) the person must submit an undertaking to waive the right to seek or pursue any remedy or claim in this regard, which may otherwise be available under any law in force or any bilateral agreement, and</li><li>(iv) other conditions, as may be prescribed.</li><li>The Act ensures that there cannot exist any future demand by the government for the collection of taxes on the basis of an amendment with retrospective effect. This Act makes the tax regime of India more predictable, increasing the scope of foreign investment into the country as it clarifies the stance of Indian Government on imposition of retrospective taxation.</li></ul>"
9," <p>With reference to the expenditure made by an organisation or a company, which of the following statements is/are correct?</p><p>1. Acquiring new technology is capital expenditure.</p><p>2. Debt financing is considered capital expenditure, while equity financing is considered revenue expenditure.</p><p>Select the correct answer using the code given below:</p>",(a) 1 only,(b) 2 only,(c) Both 1 and 2,(d) Neither 1 nor 2,Economics (Microeconomics),a,Easy,,"<ul><li>Capital expenditures (CapEx) are funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, plants, buildings, technology, or equipment. CapEx is often used to undertake new projects or investments by a company. Costs to upgrade or purchase software, investing in new technology and computer equipment, are considered part of Capital expenditure. As they are often employed to improve operational efficiency, increase revenue in the long term, or make improvements to the existing assets of a company. Hence statement 1 is correct.</li><li>When a company borrows money to be paid back at a future date with interest it is known as debt financing. It occurs when a firm sells fixed income products, such as bonds, bills, or notes. It could be in the form of a secured as well as an unsecured loan. Debt financing is the opposite of equity financing, which entails issuing stock to raise money. For example, reliance can choose debt financing, which entails selling fixed income products, such as bonds, bills, or notes, to investors to obtain the capital needed to grow and expand its operations. Both debt financing and equity financing are considered as part of capital receipts for the company, as capital receipts are receipts that create liabilities or reduce financial assets. Funds from these would be used by company for capital expenditure such as to grow or expand its operations. Hence statement 2 is not correct.</li></ul>"
10," <p>With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements :</p><p>1. A share of the household financial savings goes towards government borrowings.</p><p>2. Dated securities issued at market-related rates in auctions form a large component of internal debt.</p><p>Which of the above statements is/are correct ?</p>",(a) 1 only,(b) 2 only,(c) Both l and 2,(d) Neither 1 nor 2,Economics (Macroeconomics),c,Medium,,"<ul><li>Household financial savings refer to currency, bank deposits, debt securities, mutual funds, pension funds, insurance, and investments in small savings schemes by households. The net household financial savings was 11.5 percent of GNDI (gross national disposal income) in 2020-21. A part of this financial saving goes toward government borrowing. As government borrows through the issue of government securities called G-secs and Treasury Bills. It borrows from the market, small savings funds, state provident funds, external assistance and short-term borrowings. Any adverse movement in the household savings will have a significant bearing on banks, insurance companies and mutual/provident funds, who, in turn, are key investors in government securities. Hence statement 1 is correct.</li><li>The Central Government Debt includes all liabilities of Central Government contracted against the Consolidated Fund of India (defined as Public Debt). Public debt is further classified into internal and external debt. Internal debt</li><li>consists of marketable debt and non-marketable debt. Marketable debt comprises of Government dated</li><li>securities and Treasury Bills, issued through auctions. Non-marketable debt comprises of intermediate</li><li>Treasury Bills (14 days ITBs) issued to State Governments/UTs as well as select Central Banks, special securities issued against small savings, special securities issued to public sector banks/EXIM Bank, securities issued to international financial institutions, and compensation and other bonds. </li><li>All marketable securities i.e. Dated securities and Treasury bills are issued through auctions as per the schedule notified through halfyearly/quarterly auction calendars. As at end-March 2021, outstanding amounts under dated securities stood at 71.7 lakh crore (36.3 per cent of GDP) and accounted for 68.1 per cent of the total Public Debt. Hence statement 2 is correct.</li></ul>"
11," <p>Consider the following statements :</p><p>1. Pursuant to the report of H.N. Sanyal Committee, the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 was passed.</p><p>2. The Constitution of India empowers the Supreme Court and the High Courts to punish for contempt of themselves.</p><p>3.

The committee made a comprehensive examination of the law and problems relating to contempt of court in the light of the position obtaining in our own country and various foreign countries. The recommendations, which the committee made, took note of the importance given to freedom of speech in the Constitution and of the need for safeguarding the status and dignity of courts and interests of administration of justice.</li><li>Statement 2 is correct: Article 129 of the Constitution gives the Supreme Court the power to initiate contempt cases on its own, independent of the motion brought before it by the Attorney General (AG) or with the consent of the AG.</li><li>Statement 3 is not correct and Statement 4 is correct: Contempt of court seeks to protect judicial institutions from motivated attacks and unwarranted criticism, and as a legal mechanism to punish those who lower its authority. The expression ‘contempt of court’ has not been defined by the Constitution. The Contempt of Court Act, 1971 defines both civil and criminal contempt. Hence the Parliament is vested with the powers to make laws regarding contempt of court.</li></ul>"
12," <p>With reference to India, consider the following statements :</p><p>1. Government law officers and legal firms are recognised as advocates, but corporate lawyers and patent attorneys are excluded from recognition as advocates.</p><p>2. Bar Councils have the power to lay down the rules relating to legal education and recognition of law colleges.</p><p>Which of the statements given above is/are correct?</p>",(a) 1 only,(b) 2 only,(c) Both 1 and 2,(d) Neither 1 nor 2,Polity And Governance,b,Difficult,t,"<ul><li>The role of the legal profession in society is manifold—its members are flag-bearers of the rule of law and they defend fundamental rights. Along with these responsibilities, members of the legal profession have been conferred significant power and privileges as officers of the court. First, only advocates have the right to access and represent others in a court of law. No citizen, other than an advocate, has the right to appear, act, or plead in court. Second, in India, the term “legal professionals” refers only to those “advocates” who are law graduates and have been enrolled in state bar councils (SBCs). </li><li>Statement 1 is not correct: An emerging class of legal professionals engaged with various law-related activities—such as government law officers, corporate lawyers, law firms, law professors, legal researchers, and patent attorneys—have been excluded from recognition as advocates. </li><li>Third, the judiciary has clarified the otherwise undefined concept of “practice of law” to include all forms of legal activities, including both litigious and non-litigious work, such as appearing in court, drafting, giving opinions, performing transactional work, consulting, arbitrating, mediating, filing vakalatnamas (power of attorney), and working as legal officers. Thus, “advocates” enrolled in bar councils enjoy exclusive monopoly over the right to practise law in all courts, tribunals, and other authorities in India.</li><li>Statement 2 is correct: The Advocates Act, 1961, enacted with the objective of creating “a unified Bar for the whole country with monopoly in legal practice and autonomy in matters of professional management,” conferred the Bar Council of India (BCI) and SBCs with the power to self-regulate the profession and lay down rules relating to admission and enrolment, conditions of practice, standards of professional conduct and etiquette, disciplinary proceedings, legal education, recognition of law colleges, and welfare activities. These powers were granted to the bar councils to promote the administration of justice and uphold the dignity of the profession in the eyes of the common people.</li></ul>"

It means that the ministry stays in office so long as it enjoys the confidence of the majority of the members of the Lok Sabha. In other words, the Lok Sabha can remove the ministry from office by passing a no-confidence motion. The motion needs the support of 50 members to be admitted.</li><li>Option 3 is not correct: Article 61 of the Indian Constitution states that when a President is to be impeached for violation of the Constitution, the charge shall be preferred by either House of Parliament.</li><li>Either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha can initiate the process for the removal of the President of India.</li></ul>"
16," <p>With reference to anti-defection law in India, consider the following statements:</p><p>1. The law specifies that a nominated legislator cannot join any political party within six months of being appointed to the House.</p><p>2.

It observed that after the 1967 general elections, defections changed the political scene in India as 176 of 376 independent legislators later joined a political party.</li><li>The next legislative attempt, in 1978, allowed independent and nominated legislators to join a political party once. </li><li>With rising public opinion for an anti-defection law, immediately after securing a clear majority in 1984, the Rajiv Gandhi's government proposed the new anti-defection bill in the Parliament. After marathon debates, both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha unanimously approved the bill and through the 52nd amendment to the Constitution of India, the Tenth Schedule was inserted into the constitution.</li><li>The Tenth Schedule contains the following provisions with respect to the disqualification of members of Parliament and the state legislatures on the ground of defection:<ul><li>Members of Political Parties: A member of a House belonging to any political party becomes disqualified for being a member of the House,</li><li>if he voluntarily gives up his membership of such political party or</li><li>if he votes or abstains from voting in such House contrary to any direction issued by his political party without obtaining prior permission of such party and such act has not been condoned by the party within 15 days.</li><li>In the case of ‘voluntarily giving up his membership,' the Supreme Court has interpreted that in the absence of a formal resignation by the member, the giving up of membership can be inferred by his conduct. In other judgments, members who have publicly expressed opposition to their party or support for another party were deemed to have resigned.</li></ul></li><li>Thus, a legislator’s speech and conduct inside and outside the legislature can lead to disqualification under the anti-defection law. </li><li>Independent Members: An independent member of a House (elected without being set up as a candidate by any political party) becomes disqualified to remain a member of the House if he joins any political party after such election.</li><li>Statement 1 is not correct: Nominated Members: A nominated member of a House becomes disqualified for being a member of the House if he joins any political party after the expiry of six months from the date on which he takes his seat in the House.

Central banks engage in tight monetary policy when an economy is accelerating too quickly or inflation is rising too fast and usually involves increasing interest rates.</li><li>Tight monetary policy of US Federal Reserve means hiking the federal funds rate–the rate at which banks lend to each other–increases borrowing rates and slows lending. Rate increases make borrowing less attractive as interest payments increase. It affects all types of borrowing including personal loans, mortgages, and interest rates on credit cards. Faster Fed rate could rattle financial markets and tighten financial conditions globally especially in emerging market economies like India. For instance, an aggressive monetary tightening would raise US yields and strengthen the US dollar against EM currencies like rupee. As a result, US- based foreign portfolio investors/Foreign institutional investors investing in countries like India would pull money out from here and invest in ""safe heaven"" US assets (Treasury bonds) and thus leading significant capital flight from India. Hence statement 1 is correct. </li><li>The sudden stops and reversal of capital flows will lead to depreciation pressures on emerging market currencies like rupee. When foreign investors invest in equities, bonds and other financial assets in EMEs, they measure financial returns in the US dollar and other foreign currencies. If the EM currency depreciates against the US dollar, it decreases the value of their investments in dollar terms and, therefore, they may engage in distress sales of funds. This capital flight may increase interest cost of firms with a large stock of foreign currency debt as rising US dollar would increase the debt-servicing costs (in local currencies) for firms. Hence statement 2 is correct. </li><li>Devaluation of domestic currency increases the currency risk associated with ECBs (as mostly foreign currency denominated). For instance, if at the time of raising loan through ECBs, 1 dollar was equal to Rs 75 and in future with depreciation/devaluation of domestic currency, 1 dollar becomes Rs 80. In this case, companies/firms done borrowing through ECBs would have to pay back more as converting more rupee with their dollar equivalent and in turn increases their currency risk.

Further, issuing convertible bonds can also help provide investors with some security in the event of default. A convertible bond protects investors' principal on the downside, but allows them to participate in the upside should the underlying company succeed. However, convertible bonds tend to offer a lower coupon rate or rate of return in exchange for the value of the option to convert the bond into common stock. Companies benefit since they can issue debt at lower interest rates than with traditional bond offerings. However, not all companies offer convertible bonds. Hence statement 1 is correct.</li><li>The option to convert to equity affords the bondholder a degree of indexation to rising consumer prices. As indexation will ensure that prices are adjusted with inflation over a period of time. With the help of indexation, bondholders will be able to lower their long-term capital gains (as their investment will be adjusted with inflation) even when converting bonds into equity, which brings down their taxable income.

This responsibility is explicitly mandated under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth. Price stability is a necessary precondition to sustainable growth.</li><li>The MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) determines the policy interest rate required to achieve the inflation target. The Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy Department (MPD) assists the MPC in formulating the monetary policy. Views of key stakeholders in the economy, and analytical work of the Reserve Bank contribute to the process for arriving at the decision on the policy repo rate. The Financial Markets Operations Department (FMOD) of RBI operationalises the monetary policy, mainly through day-to-day liquidity management operations. The Financial Markets Committee (FMC) meets daily to review the liquidity conditions so as to ensure that the operating target of the weighted average call money rate (WACR) is aligned with the repo rate. </li><li>There are several direct and indirect instruments that are used by RBI for implementing monetary policy for price stability by keeping check on inflation such as Repo rate, Reverse repo, Open market operations, Liquidity adjustment facility, etc. For example, RBI does it by increasing the repo rate in the economy, if inflation is high. Increase in interest rate is believed to bring down the inflation level in the economy by curtailing the amount of economic activity whereas decreasing the interest rate increases the inflation level of the economy by increasing the economic activity. Hence option (d) is the correct answer.</li></ul>"

All the three Sangams took place at different places under the patronage of the Pandya kings of Madurai.</li><li>Women in the Sangam period appear to have been educated. This is testified by many poems contributed by women poets to the Sangam literature. Women are also described as engaged in various economic activities such as paddy plantation, cattle rearing, basket-making, spinning, etc. However, the cruel practice of Sati was also prevalent in Tamil society, and it was known as tippayadal. But it was not obligatory as there are references to widows present in society. However, their position was miserable as they were prohibited to decorate themselves or participate in any form of amusement. </li><li>The class of warriors was an important element in society during the Sangam age. Captains of the army were invested with the title of enadi at a formal ceremony. Civil and military officers were held under both the Cholas and the Pandyas by vellalas or rich peasants.

A significant fraction (by number, if not by mass) of interplanetary dust, that is still falling on the Earth at the rate of thousands of tons per year, is in the nanoparticle range; and the same is true of atmospheric dust particles. Many viruses have diameters in the nanoparticle range. Iron oxides/sulfides, silver, and gold are some of the representative examples of naturally-occurring nanoparticles in the environment.

The addition of silver and gold NPs is also mentioned to increase the antimicrobial and healing properties of some cosmetic formulations. Hence statement 2 is correct.</li><li>The exposure of nanoparticle to environment and human can be described through different mechanisms. Primarily occupational exposures occur to workers (including engineers, scientists, and technicians) during the research-scale synthesis and commercial production of nanomaterial-based products. This exposure mainly results from handling of raw materials while carrying out reactions through the equipment. Characterization of resulting material, packing, and transportation can be other sources of this type of exposure.

DNA barcoding is done by comparing an individual DNA sequence with a reference library of such DNA sections (called sequences). The introduction of DNA barcoding represents a promising approach for food authentication, being broadly applied in fish species. DNA barcoding has been successful when applied to seafood because the number of species is high in comparison to other animal sources, such as cattle, sheep, goat, and horse, enhancing the effectiveness of the approach. DNA barcoding techniques were used to explore the composition of roasted barley tea (Hordeum vulgare), which was exported to a certain country from China but then returned, due to the detection of other undesirable plant components present. Contaminants were found. Hence option 3 is correct.</li><li>DNA barcoding will allow users to efficiently recognize known species and speed the discovery of species yet to be found in nature.
