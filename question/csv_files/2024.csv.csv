It is the extremely slow and gradual decomposition of rocks due to exposure to air and water.

The dissolved calcium carbonate is carried away by the water, joints and cracks in the rock are quickly widened and whole systems of caves and passages are worn out.

For example, <strong>most rocks contain a certain amount of iron, which when it comes in contact with air is changed to iron oxide, familiar brownish crust or rust. Iron oxide crumbles easily and is fat more easily eroded than the original iron.</strong> It is thus removed, loosening the overall structure of the rocks and weakening them. <strong>Hence Statement III is correct and explains Statement I</strong>.</li><li><strong>Decomposition by Organic acids:</strong> Within the soil which covers most rocks are bacteria which thrive on decaying plant or animal material.
