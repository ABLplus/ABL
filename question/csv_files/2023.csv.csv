1," <p>In which one of the following regions was Dhanyakataka, which flourished as a prominent Buddhist centre under the Mahasanghikas, located?</p>",(a) Andhra,(b) Gandhara,(c) Kalinga,(d) Magadha,History (Ancient India),a,Medium,Fundamental(F),"<p>There are a few literary traditions about the <strong>presence of Buddhism in Andhra Pradesh during pre-Mauryan period. </strong>The famous Buddhist sites of Amaravati and Dhanyakataka are associated with Buddha, as a birthplace of one of the previous births of Buddha and a preaching site of Buddha respectively.<strong>Amaravati and Dharanikota, both formed part of ancient Dhanyakataka, the capital of later Satavahanas.</strong></p><p><strong>With the spread of Buddhism to different parts of the country many sects appeared. </strong>For example, <strong>the Theravadins had their centre of activity at Kausambi; Mathura was the centre for the Sarvastivadins; </strong>and the<strong> Bhadra Yanika sect flourished at Nasik and Kanheri.</strong> The origin of these sects may not have been originally due to differences in the doctrines. In fact, what contributed to their origin and growth were factors related to geographical diversities of the country, attitudes of various communities at the local levels and perhaps lack of coordination between the various exponents of the sects. <strong>Under the Satavahavas,the Dhanyakataka (Amaravati) region became the most important stronghold of Mahayana Buddhism whereas the Sthaviravadins were popular in the north.</strong></p><p><strong>Hence option (a) is the correct answer.</strong></p>"
2," <p>With reference to ancient India, consider the following statements: </p><p>1. The concept of Stupa is Buddhist in origin. </p><p>2. Stupa was generally a repository of relics. </p><p>3. Stupa was a votive and commemorative structure in Buddhist tradition. </p><p>How many of the statements given above are correct? </p>",(a) Only one,(b) Only two,(c) All three,(d) None,History (Ancient India),b,Medium,Fundamental(F),"<p>Stupa, Sanskrit for heap, is a mound-like (hemispherical) burial structure <strong>containing relics of Buddhist monks.</strong> E.g. Sanchi Stupa built over Buddha relics. <strong>Hence statement 2 is correct.</strong></p><p><strong>However, concept of stupa does not have Buddhist origin. The word Stupa is mentioned in the Rigveda, Atharvaveda, Vajasaneyi Samhita, Taittriya Samhita, etc. Hence statement 1 is not correct.</strong></p><p><strong>Rigveda refers to a Stupa raised by the King Varuna above the forest in a place having no foundation .</strong>The<strong> word ‘estuka’</strong> is also used in the same sense in Rigveda, probably by then anything raised on the ground like a heap/pile might have been known as Stupa. <strong>However the Pali word ‘thupa’ is quite similar to the term ‘Stupa’. Thupa means a conical heap, a pile or a mound or a conical or bell shaped shrine containing a relic.</strong></p><p>Stupa is regarded as a monument for veneration. But as Stupa seems to be associated with votive and commemorative and offering purposes; Stupa thus gradually was related to the<strong> ritualistic and commemorative with sectarian, affliation with school of philosophical obligatory and was bound by aspects of social- economic life. Hence statement 3 is correct.</strong></p><p>The Buddhist texts like the Avadana Satakam, Mahavadana and Stupavadanam mentions about the commemorative aspects of the Stupa even the Jaina literature like Raya Pasenaiya Sutta refers to it. Probably in the later period, due to deep desire of the common mass to worship the lord for the sake of salvation, Stupa acquired its votive character as well. </p>"
3," <p>With reference to ancient South India, Korkai, Poompuhar and Muchiri were well known as </p>",(a) capital cities,(b) ports,(c) centres of iron-and-steel making,(d) shrines of Jain tirthankaras,History (Ancient India),b,Easy,Fundamental(F),"<p><strong>Korkai, Poompuhar and Muchiri were well-known ports.</strong></p><p>The Sangam literature provides valuable insights into the urban centres and cultures of early historical South India.</p><p><strong>Kaverippumpattinam (also known as Pumpuhar or Puhar) was the premier Chola port in early historical times.</strong> Classical accounts refer to it as Khaberis or Camara.</p><p><strong>Korkai was the major Pandya port, </strong>while Tondi and <strong>Muchiri </strong>were the important ports in the <strong>Chera kingdom.</strong></p><p><strong>Hence option (b) is the correct answer.</strong></p>"
4, <p>Which one of the following explains the practice of 'Vattakirutal' as mentioned in Sangam poems?</p>,(a) Kings employing women bodyguards,(b) Learned persons assembling in royal courts to discuss religious and philosophical matters,(c) Young girls keeping watch over agricultural fields and driving away birds and animals,(d) A king defeated in a battle committing ritual suicide by starving himself to death,History (Ancient India),d,Difficult,tFundamental(F),"<p>Sangam poems are pervaded with a warrior ethic. The goal of the hero of the puram poems was pukal (glory, fame) and a heroic death was greatly valued. It was believed that the spirit of a warrior who died in battle dwelt in paradise. A poem in the Purananuru suggests that the bodies of warriors who did not die in battle were cut with swords before the funerary rites, to simulate death in battle.</p><p>The <strong>practice of vattakirutal was one in which a defeated king committed ritual suicide by starving himself to death, accompanied by those who had been close to him during his lifetime. </strong></p><p>The <strong>worship of memorial stones (natukal) </strong>was a corollary of the importance of the heroic ideal. Memorial stones were erected in honour of heroes who died fighting valiantly in battle; the spirit of the fallen hero was believed to reside in these stones.</p><p><strong>Hence option (d) is the correct answer.</strong></p>"

Yadava</p><p>How many of the above dynasties established their kingdoms in early eighth century AD?</p>,(a) Only one,(b) Only two,(c) Only three,(d) None,History (Ancient India),d,Difficult,tFundamental(F),"<p>The <strong>Hoysala era (1026 CE – 1343 CE)</strong> was marked by illustrious achievements in art, architecture, and culture. The nucleus of this activity lay in the present-day Hassan district of Karnataka, India. <strong>Hence option 1 is not correct.</strong></p><p>The <strong>Gahadavala dynasty also Gahadavalas of Kannauj was a Rajput dynasty</strong> that ruled parts of the <strong>present-day Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, during 11th and 12th centuries.</strong> Their capital was located at Banaras in the Gangetic plains, and for a brief period, they also controlled Kannauj. <strong>Hence option 2 is not correct.</strong></p><p>The <strong>Kakatiya dynasty </strong>ruled most of eastern Deccan region in present-day India <strong>between 12th and 14th centuries.</strong> Their territory comprised much of the present day Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, and parts of eastern Karnataka, northern Tamil Nadu, and southern Odisha. <strong>Hence option 3 is not correct.</strong></p><p><strong>The Seuna, Sevuna or Yadava dynasty (850 - 1334 A.D.) </strong>was an Indian dynasty, which at its peak ruled a kingdom stretching from the Tungabhadra to the Narmada rivers, including present-day Maharashtra, north Karnataka and parts of Madhya Pradesh, from its capital at Devagiri (present-day Daulatabad in Maharashtra). <strong>Hence option 4 is not correct.</strong></p>"

Thus in the principle of Due Process of Law, fairplay is ensured by giving every party a right to be heard which in essence is Audi Alteram partem or the rule of fair hearing (hear the other side) which is the very basis of the principle of natural justice. To remove the arbitrariness, the Supreme Court of India recongnised the principle of Due Process of Law in the <strong>Maneka Gandhi case.</strong> In short, <strong>Natural Justice implies fairness, reasonableness, equity and equality.

Both statements 1 and 2 are correct but statement 2 is not the correct explanation of statement 1.</strong></li><li><strong>Interpretation 2: Statement 2 could be wrong because of the use of words ""expressly kept the subject"".</strong> Although the <strong>section 59 of the Prisons Act, 1894 </strong>vests the power to make rules on prisons to the state governments <strong>but it did not place the subject to them. It was the Government of India Act 1935 which resulted in the transfer of the subject of jails from the Central List to the control of Provincial Governments and henceforth reduced the possibility of uniform implementation of a prison policy at the national level.</strong> Thus, State Governments have their own rules and regulations for the day to day administration of prisons, maintenance of prisoners, and prescribing procedures. <strong>So in this case the answer could be C.</strong></li></ul>"
